* Replace option type by the result type with a richer set of errors.

* organise the type for instantaneous values:

  type 'a bot = Bot | Top of 'a
  type 'a present = P of 'a | E
  type 'a init = Def of 'a | Nil
  type value = pvalue init present bot
  
* We need to model errors. One solution is to stop the execution, that is,
  a stream process that has an error simply stop.

  type error = TypeError | ClockError | RunTimeError | ...
  
  ('s -> (value, error) result) * 's

* or internalise it into instantaneous values.

* The dynamic checking that equations are causal is not finished. Finish it.

* Add arrays and array iterators; add static parameters (only
  sizes for the moment?).
